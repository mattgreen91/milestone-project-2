# Milestone Project 2 - Space is Fun - by Matt Green

My second project was to create an Interactive Front-End website.  

I have chosen to design a website for young explorers, which displays information about space through pop-ups, games, animations and interactive maps.

 _**You can access the completed website by [clicking here](https://mattgreen91.github.io/milestone-project-2/index.html) :rocket:**_

The website was created using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, JSON and external APIs and Plug-ins.

The website has been designed and tested to be fully functional on all devices, including a drop-down mobile navigation menu for smaller devices.

## 1. UX - User Experience 
 
The Website is predominantly designed for teenagers who are learning for education, but it can be used by anyone with an interest in space.  

The user is able to learn key facts about all of the planets in our solar system.  

The user is able to play fun games to learn pictures and names of planets and galaxies, and learn the names of some of the moons in our solar system.  

The user can also view an interactive map which displays the live coordinates of the International Space Satellite plotted onto the map.  

There is also animations and hover effects to make the page more fun. 

**User Stories**

- As a user, I want the website layout to be clear and concise.
- As a user, I want the colours to be appealing but also easy on the eye.
- As a user, I want the navigation to be easy to use, and for me not to get lost in the website.
- As a user, I want all the links to work correctly.
- As a user, I want the website to be very interactive.
- As a user, I don't want too much text to scroll through.
- As a user, I want all the information to be easy to find.
- As a user, I want all the images to be clear, not pixelised.
- As a user, I want the map and games to be fun and work correctly.
- As a user, I want the content to adjust automatically when using multiple screen sizes and devices.
- As a user, I want some animation so the page is appealing.

**Design**

This project was designed with Balsamiq Wireframes, which can be seen below:

<img src="assets/readme-files/wireframe_2.png" width="1000" style="margin: 0;">

At first I created the basic layout by making a boilerplate, that you can find [here](assets/boilerplate/boilerplate.html).

Although my project only required me to use either Vanilla Javascript, JQuery, JSON, APIs or plug-ins, I decided that I wanted to use all of these in my project to demonstrate the skills that I have learnt.



The planet page was made using excel. assets/readme-files/planet_grid.xlsx

**Accessibility**

The project has many features such as:

* Fall-back fonts, in case Google Fonts are not compatible with the browser
* Alternate Text' attributes for images, in case the images do not display
* Fall-back messages in the iFrames, in case the iFrames are not compatible with the browser
* 'ARIA Hidden' attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), and 'Screen-Reader Only' attributes to make it easier for Screen Readers
* @media Queries, to modify content to fit different sized screens

## 2. Features

The main features of this project are:
 
### Existing Features
- Simplistic Colour Design (black/white/grey) - allows users to see and process information more easily, as the colours are much more appealing to the eye.
- Stylish Font Theme - allows users to feel more engaged by matching similar fonts to space theme.
- Navigation Menu - allows users switch between pages . Hover animations to add style.
- Mobile Navigation Menu - allows users to save screen space on Mobile Devices by using an animated dropdown menu, stylish by using a rocket logo instead, so users can see more content.
- Embedded Google Maps.
- Responsive Games
- Animations

### Features Left to Implement
- The memory game needs configuring to work more cards on larger screen.

## 4. Testing

This website has been fully tested and is working correctly.  There were some bugs that I had overcome, which you can see by [clicking here](assets/readme-files/issues-experienced.pdf).

I used the Google Chrome and Mozilla FireFox developer tools to tweak code when testing.

30. All HTML5 and CSS3 code run through official W3C validator.

## 5. Deployment

This project was created using GitPod IDE which was recommended by Code Institute.  The reason for choosing this IDE is because it is all online, so no additional software needs to be installed, and the project can be accessed and edited on any workstation, as long as internet is available.

Code Institute had provided an Initial Template which included all the relevent extensions to aid with my project. The template can be accessed by [clicking here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

For ease, I downloaded the GitPod [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en) and [Mozilla Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/).  By doing this, a green Gitpod button appears on the project's GitHub page - linking the project directly to the workspace.

The CLI (Command Line Interface) is built into GitPod, which means no additional software needs to be downloaded.

The process for adding/modifying/removing content is as per below:

`git add "file-name-1.ext"` _to add the first new/modified file to the staging area_

`git add "file-name-2.ext"` _to add the second new/modified file to the staging area_

Once all files have been added/updated then...

`git commit -m "commit message goes here"` _the commit message needs to be entered inside the inverted commmas " "_

`git push` _this commmand push the content into the GitHub repository_


When there are multiple files, it can take a long time to add all modifications, so instead I used a shortcut:

`git status`  _to view all status changes_

`all modifications will now be listed here on the CLI`

`git add .`  _the . means 'all above', so this command will update all changes_

`git commit -m "commit message goes here"`  _commit message needs to be entered inside the inverted commas " "_

`git push`  _this commmand push the content into the GitHub repository_


Code Institute also provided a [Readme Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) which I used as a guideline for creating this Readme file.

The project can be opened by [clicking here](https://mattgreen91.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html)
